// Syntax of arrow functions
// Arrow functions allows you to write shorter 
// and cleaner functions.

/*  Key features

1> Paranthesis around parameters are optional
   if you have only one paramter.

2> Curly braces {} are optional if the function has a single statement.

3> If the function has multiple statements , use curly braces {} and 
   an explicit return statement.

4> If the function takes no parameters, use empty parenthesis ().

?? Differences Between Traditional Functions and Arrow Functions
  *  While arrow functions provide a cleaner syntax, they behave differently
  *  from traditional functions in some key ways - particularly in how 
  *  they handle the this keyword.
  
?? Scope of `this` in Arrow Functions
 *  In Js, the this keyword refers to the object that owns the function .
 *  With tradtional functions, this changes based on how the function is called.
 *  However arrow functions do not have their own this. Instead, they inherit 
 *  this from the surrounding(lexical) context.
